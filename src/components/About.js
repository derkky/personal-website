                <Typography>
                    I love learning new things and challenging myself. In the past 4 years I have:
                </Typography>
                <List>
                    {listPoints.map((point, idx) =>

                                bgcolor: "#bbb"
                            }
                        }}>
                            <ListItemIcon>
                                {point.icon}

                        </ListItem>

                </List>
                <Typography>
                    â€¦ and much more!
                </Typography>
                <br/>
                <Typography>
                    In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching anime, and cooking.
                </Typography>

                <Typography>
                    I also graduated from the National University of Singapore with a double degree in Business and Communications and New Media.
